                <p>Laced with intricacy, detail, and dedicated world building, 
                    Alchemy of Souls has all the hallmarks of a noteworthy, 
                    memorable K-Drama. Yet its occasionally circular narrative, 
                    or sometimes its noticeably methodical pacing, 
                    at times became a drawback of the famous Hong sisters’ latest project, 
                    slowing down the climb to the season’s seamlessly memorable finale.
                    Plot wise, the show revolves around the lives of people residing in a place not known to regular humans, Daeho.
                     There, mages, sorcerers, assassins, maids and all manner of other imaginable people ply their trade, 
                     helping the numerous areas of this restricted world function.
                     If that sounds complex, it’s because it certainly is, yet Alchemy of Souls goes one step further by focusing in on a select number of characters, and their lives within Daeho, 
                     too. Chiefly, there’s Jang Uk, a developing mage who, once his gate of energy is unlocked, navigates the journey from being a clumsy no-hoper to a refined,
                      confident man. He’s aided largely by Mu-deok, who houses the soul of the former assassin Naksu.
                       The two have an unconventional relationship that evolves into so much more, and allows for both to grow into intrinsically better people.On the opposite side of things, Jin Mu is the central antagonist. A cynical assistant Gwanju that seeks to control Daeho through outlawed sorcery, all while manipulating those around him, he’s the typically astute, hard-to-beat foil for the proverbial good guys, and instantly detestable. Add to that a stacked support cast which ranges from swindlers to soul shifting Queens, and again it’s clear just how layered Alchemy of Souls is.
