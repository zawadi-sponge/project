  THE EVENTS USED;
  1. click
     An element receives a click event when a pointing device button (such as a mouse's primary mouse button) is both pressed and released while the pointer is located inside the element.

    If the button is pressed on one element and the pointer is moved outside the element before the button is released, the event is fired on the most specific ancestor element that contained both elements.

  2. setTimeInterval
     The setInterval() method, offered on the Window and Worker interfaces, repeatedly calls a function or executes a code snippet, with a fixed time delay between each call.

    This method returns an interval ID which uniquely identifies the interval, so you can remove it later by calling clearInterval().

  3. clearTimeInterval
     The global clearInterval() method cancels a timed, repeating action which was previously established by a call to setInterval(). If the parameter provided does not identify a previously established action, this method does nothing.

  4. alert 
    window.alert() instructs the browser to display a dialog with an optional message, and to wait until the user dismisses the dialog.

    Under some conditions — for example, when the user switches tabs — the browser may not actually display a dialog, or may not wait for the user to dismiss the dialog.

  5. mouseover
    The mouseover event is fired at an Element when a pointing device (such as a mouse or trackpad) is used to move the cursor onto the element or one of its child elements.
